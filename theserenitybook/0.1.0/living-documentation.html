<h1>What is Living documentation</h1>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Serenity BDD is more than a library that generates test reports. That is, while you can use Serenity BDD to produce great test reports just fine, the real goal of Serenity BDD is to produce <em>living documentation</em> for your product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what do we mean by "living documentation"? Living Documentation is a concept that comes from the world of Behaviour Driven Development. It is closely related to the idea of Executable Specifications. Living documentation is, as the name suggests, both <em>documentation</em>, and <em>living</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is <em>documentation</em>, because it describes how an application works, and what business rules it applies, in a way that normal users can understand. Well written living documentation can be used by new team members to understand what a product does, and how it works. It can be handed over to a maintenance team when the application goes into production, or it can be used as evidence for auditors to show that the application respects the relevant rules and regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is <em>living</em>, because it is generated by the automated test suite, and is therefore by definition it is always up-to-date.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a Serenity BDD report, you can find the Living Documentation in the <code>Requirements</code> tab.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig-requirements-tab" class="imageblock">

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_living_documentation_and_test_reporting"><a class="anchor" href="#_living_documentation_and_test_reporting"></a>Living Documentation and Test Reporting</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Living Documentation should not be confused with conventional test reporting. There are a number of important differences, and understanding these differences makes it easier to write good quality living documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_timing"><a class="anchor" href="#_timing"></a>Timing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conventional test reports are designed and generated fairly late in the development process, typically once features have been delivered and the automated tests written. Testers will often start preparatory work on test cases once the specifications or user stories are finalised, but test reports are still an activity that happens later rather than earlier in the development process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a team practicing BDD, on the other hand, the work on Living Documentation starts much earlier. Teams practicing BDD will work together with product owners to define acceptance criteria for the stories to be developed, and these acceptance criteria will form the basis for the automated acceptance tests <em>and</em> for the living documentation that is generated with each build.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_authors"><a class="anchor" href="#_authors"></a>Authors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Test Reports are the responsibility of QA; testers are usually the ones who design the report structure (if any design is done) and generate the test reports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Living Documentation, on the other hand, is written collaboratively by many different actors: BAs, developers, testers and product owners all play key roles in the BDD requirements discovery process, and help, together, to express the business needs in a form that can be executed as automated acceptance tests.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_audience_and_language"><a class="anchor" href="#_audience_and_language"></a>Audience and Language</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Testers are also the primary consumers of test reports. In many projects, other team members will only ever see test report summaries or overviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Living Documentation is for the whole team, including product owners, stakeholders and users involved in the project. It describes what the application should do before a feature is implemented (in the form of pending scenarios), and demonstrates (and gives evidence) that the implemented feature behaves as expected (in the form of passing scenarios). For this reason, living documentation scenarios need to be written in business terms, in a way that is easily understandable by non-testers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_purpose_and_scope"><a class="anchor" href="#_purpose_and_scope"></a>Purpose and scope</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Produced by testers and for testers, a test report naturally has a very strong testing focus. The emphasis is primarily on knowing whether a test passes or fails, and, at a higher level, knowing what proportion of tests pass or fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Living Documentation is more like a very detailed illustrated user manual. The focus is about describing what the application does, in business terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a scenario in a test report might be interested in checking whether all of the countries appear in a country drop-down list on a user registration page. A scenario appearing in a living documentation report would be more interested in describing the user registration process as a whole, and demonstrating how it works for different types of users, and what business constraints or limitations apply to the choice of countries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These differences can be summed up in the following table:</p>

<h2 id="_living_documentation_and_other_types_of_tests"><a class="anchor" href="#_living_documentation_and_other_types_of_tests"></a>Living Documentation and other types of tests</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Living Documentation is designed to work together with lower-level unit and integration testing to provide a high degree of confidence in the quality of the application. Living documentation will generally focus on key examples of positive and negative paths through the application, and leave the more exhaustive testing to the unit test layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In highly regulated environments, on the other hand, living documentation will often be more exhaustive and detailed, as it may be used for audits or regulatory reporting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Serenity, living documentation can be "layered", so that the most important details are presented first, and the more exhaustive scenarios presented further down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the heart of this reporting is the <em>Requirements</em> tab. Let&#8217;s see what you will find there.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h1 id="_the_requirements_view" class="sect0"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_requirements_view"></a>The Requirements view</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Serenity&#8217;s requirements view is a core part of the Serenity reporting approach, and understanding how it works is key to producing great living documentation. The Serenity living documentation goes far beyond traditional test reporting: in mature BDD teams working in large organisations, stakeholders regularly use the living documentation produced by Serenity not only to validate and document new releases, but also to explain and document how the system works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the various parts of this report, to better understand you might configure them in your own projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_requirements_hierarchy"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_requirements_hierarchy"></a>The Requirements Hierarchy</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Serenity, requirements are organised in a hierarchy. You can see this hierarchy in the tree structure in the bottom part of the Requirements tab shown in <a href="#fig-requirements-tab">A test report generated by Serenity</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few ideas of how you can organise this hierarchy at the end of this chapter. You can break your requirements down by high level capabilities down into more granular features, or it might make more sense to organise things in terms of some cross-cutting business functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all cases, the requirements hierarchy is implemented as a nested directory structure (for Cucumber or JBehave) or as a package structure (for JUnit).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Requirements hierarchy can be any depth, though it can be confusing if different branches have different depths. At the bottom level are the feature files (for Cucumber), story files (for JBehave) or test classes (for JUnit). The directories that contain these files represent the higher level requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can get an idea of the full directory structure (in the <code>src/test/features</code> directory) for the project shown in <a href="#fig-requirements-tab">A test report generated by Serenity</a> here:</p>

<p>The tree view also gives you some useful extra information.

<p>This text is a bit like an introduction to a book or to a chapter in a book - it should present the application or high level functionality that is described in detail in the rest of the report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can add this introductory text at any level of your requirements hierarchy by adding a <code>readme.md</code> file at the appropriate level of your requirements hierarchy. A well-documented set of living documentation will have <code>readme.md</code> files at each level of the hierarchy, to explain the purpose and background of each functional area in the application. You can see these files in the directory structure we looked at in the previous section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Markdown (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="bare">https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/</a>) is a convenient lightweight format that you can use to make your living documentation more readable. The markdown used in the report shown above looks like this:</p>

<pre>## Regulatory Reporting Controls

This project illustrates Serenity's living documentation capabilities, through a set of requirements for an imaginary investment bank.
 * The _Customer Due Diligence_ requirements, which are partially implemented (a mixture of pending and passing requirements), and
 * The _Reporting controls_, which contain a variety of failing acceptance tests.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For any <code>readme.md</code> in a nested requirements directory (so any <code>readme.md</code> file other than the top level one), the first line should contain the name of the requirement. An example for the <em>Customer Due Diligence</em> capability is shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Customer Due Diligence

Banks are required to "have in place adequate policies, practices and procedures that promote high ethical and professional standards and prevent the bank from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements".

Certain key elements should be included by banks in the design of KYC programmes. Such essential elements should start from the banks’ risk management and control procedures and should include

1) customer acceptance policy,
2) customer identification, and
3) on-going monitoring of high risk accounts</pre>

<p>You can also include images in the <code>readme.md</code> files. By default, Serenity will copy any files in the <code>src/test/resources/assets</code> directory into the <code>target/site/serenity/assets</code> directory when it generates the reports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can place any images you want to include in your living documentation here, and then refer to them using the Markdown image syntax, like this:</p>

<p>Features are an important part of the Serenity living documentation model. Features correspond to the contents of a feature file in Cucumber, a story file in JBehave, or a test case in JUnit. A feature represents a coherent piece of functionality that customers value; as a rule of thumb, a feature is something we could deploy by itself and the users would stil find it useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A feature contains a set of acceptance criteria, automated scenarios that demonstrate and verify how the feature works. But often the acceptance criteria are not enough in themselves to fully explain what a feature does. We need some extra information, which we provide at the top of the feature or story file. For example, in the following feature file, we give some additional business context about the <em>Business Activities</em> feature before diving into individual scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-gherkin hljs" data-lang="gherkin">Feature: Business Activities

  Some business activities are considered more risk-prone than others,
  and certain customers and entities may pose specific risks.

  Scenario Outline: The business activity risk factor for an industry

  The industry risk factor is a value from 0 to 10.

    When a customer works in &lt;Business Category&gt;
    Then their base business activity risk factor should be &lt;Risk Factor&gt;

    Examples:
      | Business Category        | Risk Factor |
      | Casino                   | 10          |
      | Precious Metals Exchange | 9           |
      | Currency Exchange        | 9           |
      | Jewellery Store          | 8           |
      | Convenience Store        | 7           |
      | Real Estate Broker       | 6           |
      | Software Development     | 3           |

  Scenario Outline: The business activity risk factor for an established business
      Established businessess have been in activity for 2 years or more

        When a customer with a business risk factor of &lt;Risk Factor&gt;, such as for a &lt;Business Category&gt; business
        And the business been operation for more than two years
        Then their business activity risk rating should be &lt;Risk Rating&gt;

        Examples:
          | Risk Factor | Business Category    | Risk Rating |
          | 7 or above  | Casino               | High        |
          | 5 to 7      | Jewellery Store      | Medium      |

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you use Serenity with Cucumber, you can turn this feature overview into a rich living document that mixes business rules with examples and scenarios drawn from the acceptance tests. This lets you design a requirements overview that product owners and stakeholders can review quickly and easily, while still keeping the details on hand if they want to know more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>T&gt; Enhanced feature documentation is currently only supported for Cucumber.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we could improve the <em>Business Activities</em> feature overview by embedding the tables (but not the "Given..When..Then" texts which essentially act as text fixtures in this case). To do this, we use the <code>{Examples}</code> tag along with the name of the scenario outline that we want to use:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-gherkin hljs" data-lang="gherkin">Feature: Business Activities

  Some business activities are considered more risk-prone than others,
  and certain customers and entities may pose specific risks.
  The business activity risk factor for an industry is determined by the potential risk they present to the bank. For example:

  {Examples} The business activity risk factor for an industry</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the report is generated, Serenity will include the example table from the <em>The business activity risk factor for an industry</em> scenario in the feature description (see <a href="#fig-requirements-embedded-table">Example tables from the scenarios can be included in the feature overview</a>).</p>

<div class="title">Figure 9. Example tables from the scenarios can be included in the feature overview</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the tests for this table have been executed, the result for each row will be indicated in the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default form (using the <code>{Examples}</code> tag) will take <em>only</em> the examples table from the scenario outline; if you would like the title to be displayed as well, you can use the <code>{Examples!WithTitle}</code> tag instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenarios are generally to granular for the feature summary, and best left for the detailed section further down the page. However sometimes it makes sense to include a scenario or two in the summary. You can do this by using the <code>{Scenario}</code> tag. This works for both scenarios and scenario outlines.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The aim of any software project is to help our stakeholders achieve their <em>goals</em> by providing them with <em>capabilities</em>. In BDD, a <em>Capability</em> is something that allows users to do something that they couldn&#8217;t do previously, or to do something that they could do previously, but do it more efficiently. A capability is technology-agnostic: it does not commit to a particular solution or implementation. An example of a capability might be the ability to pay online with a credit card.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>Feature</em> is a concrete solution or implementation that delivers a capability. Some possible features that deliver the capability we mentioned earlier might be to pay via PayPal, via Stripe or to pay by integrating with a merchant banking platform.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Scrum, an <em>Epic</em> is simply a big user story, one that can&#8217;t be delivered in a sprint. A <em>Theme</em> is just another way to group related User Stories, though many teams use Themes as groups of related epics. (Another way to implement the original idea of themes in Serenity BDD is to use tags).</p>

<h2 id="_user_stories"><a class="anchor" href="#_user_stories"></a>User Stories</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User Stories are commonly used in Agile as a way to organise work, but they are not always very useful when it comes to Living Documentation. This is because they reflect how a feature was sliced up when it was built. But once a feature is delivered, no one cares how it was broken down during the development phase - all that matters is what was delivered. That&#8217;s why Cucumber prefers to group scenarios in Feature Files (which describe a feature). For this reason, User Stories are generally considered to be not a great way to structure living documentation. (Note that JBehave still uses the older convention of "Story Files", which were meant to contain the acceptance criteria of a given story).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can configure the way Serenity names the different levels in your own requirements structure using the <code>serenity.requirements.types</code> property. For example, if you want to describe your requirements in terms of themes, epics and stories, you would add the following to your Serenity configuration file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>serenity.requirements.types=theme,epic,story</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t configure this parameter, Serenity will decide on a sensible default hierarchy. This hierarchy depends on whether you are using JUnit, Cucumber or JBehave, and on the depth of your requirements hierarchy:</p>
</div>
<table class="tableblock frame-topbot grid-all" style="width: 80%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%;">
<col style="width: 50%;">

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teams write automated acceptance tests with Serenity BDD using JUnit. The Screenplay Pattern in particular makes it easy to write highly maintainable tests using a business-readable DSL that produces excellent living documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JUnit acceptance tests should be organised in a package structure that reflects your requirements hierarchy. Note that this means that they may not reflect the package structure in your application, as is usually done for unit and integration tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple two-level hierarchy is illustrated here:</p>

<div class="listingblock">

                ├── AddingNewItems.java
                ├── DeletingItems.java
                ├── FilteringItemsByStatus.java
                └── MarkingItemsAsComplete.java</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to tell Serenity where to find the requirements hierarchy in your package structure, using the <code>serenity.test.root</code> property. For the example shown above, the root package is <code>com.acme.myapp.specs</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>serenity.test.root=com.acme.myapp.specs</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, the Serenity living documentation will treat the JUnit test cases ("Adding New Items", "Deleting Items" etc.) as Stories, and the packages directly underneath the <code>com.acme.myapp.specs</code> package ("Multiple Todo Lists", "Sharing Lists" etc.) as Features.</p>
