    <h1>The Serenity Book</h1>

	<p>Serenity BDD is an open source library that helps you write better,
	more effective automated acceptance tests, and use these acceptance tests
	to produce world-class test reports and living documentation.</p>

	<p>Serenity BDD helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated
	acceptance and regression tests faster. Serenity also uses the test results
	to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what
	your application does and how it works. Serenity tells you not only what tests
	have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.</p>

	<p>This book is the definitive guide to writing automated acceptance tests with Serenity BDD</p>
